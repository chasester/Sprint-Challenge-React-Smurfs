1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
With client-side routing the cleint Redirects and pics the url and updates the url locally, meaning that more of the website is exposed to the user, This is gennerally paired with server calls to get updated infomation. This means that extra info and how to build the page can be loaded once on entry of the web page and then the info can be loaded as needed. Rather than every link forces a new call to the server which loads all the info from the server ranther than just the data. Client-side routing can back store the data recieved by the server and doesnt have to update on every change of address (only if the logic dictates it) this can lead to a quicker and more seemless expirence for the end-user.
